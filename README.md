This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to accessing non-existent attributes and properties of elements.  The bug.html file shows how accessing a non-existent attribute returns undefined silently, while accessing a non-existent property throws a TypeError.  The bugSolution.html file doesn't directly 'fix' the bug (as the silent return of undefined is sometimes expected behavior), but illustrates the difference and clarifies the behavior.  It emphasizes best practices: explicit attribute checks to avoid unexpected behavior.
